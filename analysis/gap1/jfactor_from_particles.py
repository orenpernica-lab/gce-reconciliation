"""J-factor maps from HESTIA particle data.

Muru's released maps are dm2 = (int rho ds)^2. The annihilation signal is
J = int rho^2 ds. Abazajian, Kumar & Macias (arXiv:2609.34155) point out these
are not the same quantity and that squaring a non-negative map leaves its
isophote shapes unchanged, so a morphology conclusion drawn from dm2 is a
statement about projected mass, not about annihilation. Our own
rho2_definition_test.py found the same thing from the other side: c4 is
immune to the difference (|dc4| <= 0.001) while the radial profile moves by
65-70%.

Muru has now sent truncated particle data, so the J-factor can be computed
directly instead of argued about. This module does that.

Method. Estimate rho at each sample point from the particles with an adaptive
kernel, then integrate rho^2 along the line of sight from the solar position
using the same ray tracing as project_template.

The trap, and why this is not a one-liner: rho^2 weights dense regions
quadratically, so subhalos and shot noise dominate unless the density estimate
is smoothed on a physically chosen scale. Too small a kernel and the map is a
field of spikes that are resolution, not structure. Too large and the central
cusp - the thing the whole measurement is about - is washed out. The kernel
scale is therefore a reported parameter, not a hidden one, and selftest()
measures what it costs.
